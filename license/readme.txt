This project is distributed under a strong reciprical license and less reciprical license from CERN.  Both licenses are drafts. Users can replace the draft licenses with CERN's final versions when they become available.

All contributions to this project should be compatible with BOTH draft licenses and the final versions of these licenses.

If you want to use from this project, you can use either choose one of the two licenses, or distribute under both. If you want your edits to be merged back into the project, you will have to accept both licenses.

In the documents directory, there is a pdf copy of the wishbone spec. This spec is distributed under the terms described in the pdf, not under the licenses above.
